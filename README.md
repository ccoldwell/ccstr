# ccstr
A little c library of helpful string manipulations

## Purpose and Use
Make this and then import it as a library, or just use the header and c file in your project.  Go nuts, play, change, whatever. I just use this in all my projects becuase I'm lazy and don't want to keep writing this code. :-)

I use this on Mac and other Unix/Linux OS's.

```
make
make install
```

Code:
```
#include <ccstr>
```

Makefile:
```
gcc blah blah blah -lccstr
```
